    <h1 class="headline">  Hello my love, Merve ♡</h1>
    I have been worrying about you in the last few days, even Luca and <br>
    Besmala noticed that you were unusually absent in the last few days, <br>
    And, that is totally fine! Do, what you want and need to do, this is <br> 
    not ment to judge you, or even making you feel bad, rather the opposit. <br>
    I want to assure you, that you are not alone, that we care about you, <br>
    and that we love you. <br>
    I am not sure what you are tinking or feeling lately, I do have my <br> 
    thoughts, but I won´t imagine something that isn´t reflecting your true feelings. <br>
    So, in any case, having trouble with something, exam stress or that <br>
    we - I - made you feel bad (e.g that I didn´t went to the library <br>
    spontaneously), I am sorry and I am always gonna be avaible for you, <br>
    I am proud of you! <br>
    If nothing is wrong, or you just do not feel like socialazing, that is <br>
    totally fine - even better, but eitherways you can count this as a form <br>
    of generall praising, or assurance that, doesn´t matter what, I will, <br>
    and I am, proud of you, that I love you and that you are not alone! <br>
    If you need totalk about anything, i am here for you, text or call <br>
    me at any given time, and if I made you feel bad, do not miss the <br>
    chance to tell me, because it is never my intention and I want you <br>
    feel safe with me. <br>
    I won´t sweet talk you to death, so Imma quit right here, just know <br>
    that I did this to not pressure you, if you do not feel like <br>
    communicating, so you do not need to answer this, I am happy <br>
    that you even read this. <br>
    <br>
    I hope, after the exam - not necessarily because of them - <br>
    you feel great and love. <br>
    (And, if you still want to, we need to play Volleyball afterwards) <br>
    <br>
    Sincerely Aiden, your a bit social incompeten friend that didn´t <br>
    know how to contact you with this, while making sure you feel safe  ♡ <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    PS: My mother is possibly getting a cat, expect many pics .D <br>
    <br>
    ♡ ♡ ♡  Love youuuuu  ♡ ♡ ♡ <br>
